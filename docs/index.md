> Machine Learning models should play by the rules, literally. 

This package contains scikit-learn compatible tools that should make it easier
to construct and benchmark rule based systems that are designed by humans. 

## Features 

This library hosts a couple of models that you can play with.

### Classification Models

- `FunctionClassifier`: define a function as a classification model
- `CaseWhenClassifier`: define a tree of case when predicates for different predictions

### Regression Models 

- `FunctionRegressor`: define a function as a regression model
- `CaseWhenRegressor`: define a tree of case when predicates for different predictions
